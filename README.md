## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/ibktommy/Javascript-REMINDER-APP/blob/master/ScreenshotReminderApp.png)<br><br>

<li> This is a Reminder Web Application that I created using HTML/CSS/JS. The Javascript in the code is what makes the Reminder App functional.</li> <br>

<li> In the App, I make use of Javascript Object Oriented Programming Paradigm. I created three Classes which are instantiated in the DOM Event Listeners.<br>
<p>There is the "Input Class", "UI Class" and "Local Storage Class".</li><br>

<li> The "Input Class" is where the actual objects for the Reminder's "Title and Decription" will be created.</li>

<li> The "UI Class" is going to contain the various methods that will be used to handle fundamental functions of the App. Some 
of the functions include "Creating the Reminder Lists, Deleting Reminders, Adding Reminders" and so on.</li><br>

<li> The "Local Storage Class" contains "Static methods" that does not need instantiating. These methods will handle fucntions like:
"Adding Reminder to Local Storage, Removing Reminders From Local Storage, Adding Reminders From Local Storage to the App" and so on.</li>
